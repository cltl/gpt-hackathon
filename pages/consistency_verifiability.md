## You're Yes Then You're No: Consistency and Verifiability in Subjective versus Objective Tasks in Different Cultural Contexts by Large Generative Models

**Team:** ConsistenTeam 
## Objective

Generative models are known to be wildly inconsistent: the same prompt can generate very different outputs. These models also provide very different, and often incorrect, verifiable sources. Additionally, both datasets and models lack cultural and linguistic diversity. We test these aspects systematically in our planned experiments, where we look into an objective task (Knowledge question answering) and a more subjective task related to values in arguments.

## Research Question 
_“What is the consistency and variability of the generated answers in Subjective versus Objective Tasks in Different Cultural Contexts with generative models?”_
