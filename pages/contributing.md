# Contributing
We have lined up a few topics below. Feel free to add a new topic and to modify content for your topic.
You can add content to existing pages or add new pages as explained next.

## Adding content
### Adding content to existing pages
All pages except the index (`index.md`) are stored under the `pages` folder. These are markdown files, feel free to modify them.

### Adding pages / updating the menu
Feel free to add pages (preferably under `pages`). The menu can be updated through `_layout/menu.html`. 

### Updating the website
The GitHub pages are updated everytime one pushes to the main branch: pushing triggers a GitHub workflow that builds the site automatically.
